# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is Alzheimer's Disease Dataset
Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What is the relationship between BMI and Alzheimer's diagnosis? -- Done
 * What is the distribution of Alzheimer's diagnosis across different age groups? -- Done
 * How does the diagnosis rate vary between different genders? -- Done
 * How does educational level correlate with the risk of Alzheimer's? -- Done
 * What is the effect of smoking and alcohol consumption on Alzheimer's diagnosis? --
 * What is the correlation between cholesterol levels (total, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) and Alzheimer's diagnosis?
 * What is the relationship between head injuries and Alzheimer's? -- DONE
 * What are the major risk factors for Alzheimer's in different ethnic groups?
 * What is the effect of alcohol consumption on sleep quality among Alzheimer’s patients?
 * How do diet and physical activity levels interact to affect Alzheimer’s diagnosis?
 * What is the impact of memory complaints on Alzheimer’s diagnosis?
 * Avg Cholesterol by Age Group -- DONE

## Sketches


Distribution of Age by Alzheimer's Diagnosis:
This graph can answer the first question: What is the distribution of Alzheimer's diagnosis across different age groups?
By using variables such as age and percentage of those who are diagnosed, we can see which age group has the highest percentage of Azheimer's diagnosis, considering the fact, that there might be more people in one age group then other, which is why it is better to use average.

Memory Complaints Progression with Age:
This graph can also be beneficial to see the effect of age on memory complaints, wether old people complain more about losing memory or not.

## Milestones

- By the end of this week, three of the questions will be answered by various graphs
- Another three questions will be answered by the end of the next week
- And the last three questions will be answered by 26th of October or if sooner by, 2oth of October.
