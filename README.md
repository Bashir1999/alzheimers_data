# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is Alzheimer's Disease Dataset
Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What is the distribution of Alzheimer's diagnosis across different age groups? 
 * How does the diagnosis rate vary between different genders?
 * What is the relationship between BMI and Alzheimer's diagnosis?
 * How does educational level correlate with the risk of Alzheimer's?
 * What is the effect of smoking and alcohol consumption on Alzheimer's diagnosis?
 * What is the correlation between cholesterol levels (total, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) and Alzheimer's diagnosis?
 * What is the relationship between head injuries and Alzheimer's?
 * What are the major risk factors for Alzheimer's in different ethnic groups?
 * What is the effect of alcohol consumption on sleep quality among Alzheimer’s patients?
 * How do diet and physical activity levels interact to affect Alzheimer’s diagnosis?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

Also, you can study the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curran/dataviz-project-template-proposal/master/README.md) to figure out Markdown formatting. You can use the GitHub built-in editor to edit the document.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
